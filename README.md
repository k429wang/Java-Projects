# Java-Projects

Various Java projects I worked on throughout high school. 

Included are a series of Canadian Computing Competition(CCC) questions that I solved, and various other side projects.

The original CCC questions that I solved can be found on the Universty of Waterloo's website. The following are the years that I competed in:
